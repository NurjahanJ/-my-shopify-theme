## Alternative Solution
If you don't have this image, you can:
1. Replace the image src with an existing image from your assets
2. Or remove the image side entirely and make it a text-only section
3. Use a placeholder service like `https://via.placeholder.com/600x400/faf8f5/5d4037?text=YarnStitch+Workspace`

## Quick Fix
Replace the image src in the about section with:
```html
<img src='https://via.placeholder.com/600x400/faf8f5/5d4037?text=YarnStitch+Workspace' alt='YarnStitch crafting workspace' />
```
